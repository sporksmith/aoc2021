My solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

I used [my AoC 2020](https://github.com/sporksmith/aoc2020) to help solidify
some basic Rust skills. This year I expect I will be trying to stretch this
some more, probably dipping into severe over-engineering. In particular I
intent to practice working with async and await, though it's pretty silly for
these kind of puzzles.
